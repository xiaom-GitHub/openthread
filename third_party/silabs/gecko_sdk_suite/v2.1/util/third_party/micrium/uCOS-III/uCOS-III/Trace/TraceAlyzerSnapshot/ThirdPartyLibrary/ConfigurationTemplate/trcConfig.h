 * Macro which should be defined as either zero (0) or one (1).

 *
 * ### Instance Finish Events (IFE) ###
 *
 * For tasks with "infinite" main loops (non-terminating tasks), the concept
 * of a task instance has no clear definition, it is an application-specific
 * thing. Tracealyzer allows you to define Instance Finish Events (IFEs),
 * which marks the point in a cyclic task when the "task instance" ends.
 * The IFE is a blocking kernel call, typically in the main loop of a task
 * which typically reads a message queue, waits for a semaphore or performs
 * an explicit delay.
 *
 * If USE_IMPLICIT_IFE_RULES is one (1), the kernel macros (trcKernelPort.h)
 * will define what kernel calls are considered by default to be IFEs.
 *
 * However, Implicit IFEs only applies to blocking kernel calls. If a
 * service reads a message without blocking, it does not create a new
 * instance since no blocking occurred.
 *
 * Moreover, the actual IFE might sometimes be another blocking call. We 
 * therefore allow for user-defined Explicit IFEs by calling
 *
 *     vTraceTaskInstanceIsFinished()
 *
 * right before the kernel call considered as IFE. This does not create an
 * additional event but instead stores the service code and object handle
 * of the IFE call as properties of the task.
 *
 * If using Explicit IFEs and the task also calls an Implicit IFE, this may 
 * result in additional incorrect task instances.
 * This is solved by disabling the Implicit IFEs for the task, by adding
 * a call to
 * 
 *     vTraceTaskSkipDefaultInstanceFinishedEvents()
 * 
 * in the very beginning of that task. This allows you to combine Explicit IFEs
 * for some tasks with Implicit IFEs for the rest of the tasks, if
 * USE_IMPLICIT_IFE_RULES is 1.
 *
 * By setting USE_IMPLICIT_IFE_RULES to zero (0), the implicit IFEs are disabled
 * for all tasks. Tasks will then be considered to have a single instance only, 
 * covering all execution fragments, unless you define an explicit IFE in each
 * task by calling vTraceTaskInstanceIsFinished before the blocking call.

 * concurrently active objects to 255 of each type (object class).

 * 3000 objects in total. 
 * 
 * Default is 0.
 *
 * NOTE: An object with handle above 255 will use an extra 4-byte record in 
 * the event buffer whenever referenced. Moreover, some internal tables in the
